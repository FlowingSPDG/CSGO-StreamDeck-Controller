# CSGO-StreamDeck-Controller
NodeJS program to remote-control CS:GO Client via mirv_pgl function,with StreamDeck API.

currently you need to add/edit commands directly by source code.  
which means you don't need any binds,hot-keys to exec commands.(you can use OBS's hotkeys safely,yay!)  

original Streamdeck library from https://github.com/Lange/node-elgato-stream-deck  
mirv_pgl connect library from https://github.com/advancedfx/advancedfx/blob/master/misc/mirv_pgl_test/server.js


# TODO:
 Link with GameStateIntegration  
 find good purpose of this program :(
